## 🧾 Project Overview

The **OS Module Python Project** is a study and implementation of how the Python `os` module interacts with the operating system to manage files and directories.  
It demonstrates how to **create, rename, delete, and organize files** programmatically, focusing on practical applications such as a **File Organizer** tool that sorts files by type (images, documents, videos, etc.).

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ Automatically detects file types based on their extensions  
✅ Creates categorized subfolders dynamically  
✅ Moves files safely and efficiently  
✅ Includes detailed comments in Greek for educational use  
✅ Modular and easy-to-extend structure  


---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- 🐍 **Python 3.8+**
- 📦 **os** and **os.path** modules
- 💾 System-level functions: `listdir()`, `makedirs()`, `remove()`, `rename()`
- 🧠 Educational project for understanding OS-level file operations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANASTASIA-KESISI/OS_modulePython.git
Open the main script:

bash
FileOrganizerProject/organizer.py
Set the source directory path:

python
source_dir = "C:/Users/YourName/Downloads"
Run the program:

bash
python organizer.py
The script will automatically organize files into categorized folders:

📸 Images

📄 Documents

🎵 Audio

🎬 Videos

🗜️ Archives

📁 Others

🧠 Theoretical Background
The os module acts as a bridge between Python and the operating system.
It allows developers to:

Create, rename, and delete files or directories

Navigate through file systems

Check file existence and type

Work with relative and absolute paths using os.path

In this project, the os module is used to automate file organization while maintaining simplicity and platform independence.
